Welcome to the repository showcasing innovative features designed to enhance vehicle safety and convenience through advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

Key Features
Automatic Parking Assist
Automatic Parking Assist is an advanced ADAS feature that automates parking functions such as steering, braking, and acceleration. It makes maneuvering in tight spots precise, stress-free, and safer for drivers.

Adaptive Cruise Control
Adaptive Cruise Control maintains a safe following distance by automatically adjusting the vehicle's speed based on sensor data. It enhances comfort and safety during highway driving by detecting and responding to other vehicles.

Blind Spot Monitoring
This feature continuously scans areas beside and behind the vehicle using ultrasonic sensors. It provides alerts to drivers about potential hazards in their blind spots during lane changes, improving overall safety.

Emergency SOS System
In case of a crash, the Emergency SOS System detects sudden changes in acceleration and uses GSM technology to alert emergency services and pre-set contacts. It integrates GPS to share the precise location of the crash, ensuring timely assistance.
